        <h1>My purose to create Art</h1>
        <p>As a kid I wasn't so much interested in art. However I saw paintings around my house created by my father and uncle. Looking at those paintings gave me a sense of calmness. To seek that calmness I started to engage myself in the world of art. This involved looking at nature and trying to recreate it on a piece of paper. I have made many works around the years and I want to share some special ones with the world.</p> 
        <p>I am still seeking that tranquility which allows me to never be statiated by my hunger for art.</p>
        <h2>Some things you can do for me to improve as an artist</h2>
        <ul>
